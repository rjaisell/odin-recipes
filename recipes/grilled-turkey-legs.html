        <h2> Description </h2>
        <p> These spicy turkey legs are sweet and hot just like the smoked turkey legs you get at the fair or theme park! </p>
        <p> This surprisingly easy main course was delicious And easy to do. I only made 2 legs, so next time Id split the recipe. We had corn on the cob and sweet potatoes with it. Yummy. </p>
        <h3> Ingredients </h3>
